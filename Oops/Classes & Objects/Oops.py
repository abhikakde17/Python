'''
To map with real world scenarios, we started using objects in code.
This is called object oriented programming.

#CLASS

'''Class is a blueprint for creating objects.

#creating class
class Student:
    name =“karan kumar”
    
Object are the actual instance of a class.

#creating object (instance)

s1 = Student( )
print( s1.name )


Class = Car Blueprint
Object = Actual Car
